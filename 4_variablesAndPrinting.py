# The print statement takes parameters and prints them including spaces in between
print("hello",5, True)
# At the end of each print statement, by default a \n character is printed
print("bye")
print("go to next line\nand continue printing")

# The ending \n can be overwritten as follows
print(5, True, end="")
print(5, True, end=" | ")

# The convention in value assignments to variables is to leave a blank space before and after the equal symbol
x = 3
y = 'hello'
num = y
y = 'bye'
print(x, y, num)
